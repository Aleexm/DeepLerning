 ## Data :floppy_disk:
 
 Due to the large size of our datasets, we did not upload the data on GitHub. The project structure enforces the data to be in a local Google Drive folder. The folder can be placed in the following accepted locations: `home_dir/Google Drive`, `home_dir/GoogleDrive`, `home_dir/Desktop/Google Drive`, `home_dir/Desktop/GoogleDrive`, `C:/Google Drive`, `C:/GoogleDrive`, `D:/Google Drive`, `D:/GoogleDrive`, where **home_dir** is the path to the user home directory. Inside the Google Drive folder, the application folder needs to be created, `Deep-Learning-Team16`. The data archieve can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ZK4E9jfKA8pvgsDfyMq0CiOxbw7Iq9B/view?usp=sharing). Unzip the downloaded archieve and place it in the newly created application folder, `google_drive_path/Deep-Learning-Team16/`.
 
 ## Project structure :open_file_folder:
 
 The structure of the project is presented per tasks:
 
 ### Training
 
 * `model_trainer.py` - implementation of the training pipeline class
 * `train.py` - main file for running a training session with the parameters read from configuration file
 * `image_dataset.py` - pytorch Dataset class implementation for loading and processing our images

### Testing

* `model_tester.py` - implementation of the testing pipeline class
* `test.py` - main file for running a testing session with the parameters read from configuration file
* `plot_utils.py` - script for generating [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) confusion matrices
* `layervis_utils.py` - utils functions for feature map visualization inspired by [here](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-cnn-visualizations)
* `layer_visualization.py` - main file for creating feature maps visusalization and saving them to `layervis_results` folder

### Analysis

* `analysisPlotFunctions.py` - implementation of all analysis plot functions
* `analysis.py` - main file for calling analysis plot functions to plot class accuracy, predictions a.s.o

### Others
* `logger.py` -  logging system for generating folders initial structure and saving application logs to HTML files
* `config.txt` - configuration file

### Additional folders
* `layervis_results` - for storing feature maps figures
* `output\` - for storing results for each tested arhitecture with different training and testing data
> :exclamation: For each tested scenario, we have log file from training, testing, filename list of wrongly classified images, confusion matrices in Bokeh, aggregated results, training and validation loss per epoch
* `models\` - saved trained models for each scenario
> :exclamation: Not included on GitHub due to space limitation

```

## Installation :computer:

The scripts can be run in [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Windows/Linux environment.

You need to create an Anaconda :snake: `python 3.6` environment named `dl_gts`.
Inside that environment some addition packages needs to be installed. Run the following commands inside Anaconda Prompt ‚å®:
```shell
(base) conda create -n dl_gts python=3.6 anaconda
(base) conda activate dl_gts
(dl_gts) conda install -c conda-forge pytorch
```
