 ## Data :floppy_disk:
 
 Due to the large size of our datasets, we did not upload the data on GitHub. The project structure enforces the data to be in a local Google Drive folder. The folder can be placed in the following accepted locations: `home_dir/Google Drive`, `home_dir/GoogleDrive`, `home_dir/Desktop/Google Drive`, `home_dir/Desktop/GoogleDrive`, `C:/Google Drive`, `C:/GoogleDrive`, `D:/Google Drive`, `D:/GoogleDrive`, where **home_dir** is the path to the user home directory. Inside the Google Drive folder, the application folder needs to be created
